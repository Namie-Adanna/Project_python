# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description:
In this project, I analyzed global COVID-19 data using Python and various data visualization libraries. The goal is to explore trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and reporting using real-world datasets.

By the end of the project, you will have a data analysis report with visualizations and insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## Objectives:
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Compare metrics across countries/regions.
- Visualize trends with charts and maps.
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **pandas**: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **plotly** (optional): For creating interactive visualizations like choropleth maps.
- **geopandas** (optional): For advanced geographic visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the analysis and documenting the process.

## How to Run/View the Project:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Open the project folder in Jupyter Notebook or use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb` file) and execute the cells step-by-step.
5. Visualizations will be generated and displayed within the notebook.

## Insights and Reflections:
- **India and the United States have the highest number of total reported cases**: These countries, due to their large populations and varying levels of containment measures, have seen significant case counts.

- **Vaccination Rollout**: Countries like Israel and the United States have demonstrated quick and widespread vaccination rollouts, while others like India have faced challenges in scaling vaccination efforts due to logistical issues and vaccine supply shortages.

- **Chinaâ€™s COVID-19 data**: China's total cases and deaths remained notably low, potentially due to strict containment measures and limited public reporting. This contrasts sharply with similarly populous countries like India and the U.S.

- **Death Rate and Testing**: Some countries with high testing rates, like the United States, reported higher total cases and deaths, which may be attributed to more widespread testing. In contrast, other countries with lower testing rates may have underreported cases.

This project aims to provide insights into the global impact of COVID-19 and the responses of different countries to the pandemic. The findings can be used to inform future public health strategies and vaccination efforts.
